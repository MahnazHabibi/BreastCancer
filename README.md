A Novel Machine Learning Method for Mutational Analysis to Identifying Driver Genes in Breast Cancer


Descripotion:

This repository contains the data and MATLAB code for the "Identifying driver genes associated with bearst cancer with machine learning algorithms":

Data set:

File "Benchmark.xlsx" contains a list of driver genes reported by five as benchmark sets.

Algorithms:

File "Feature_Matrix.m" is the MATLAB to calculate topological and biological features for mutated genes.

File "SPNFSR.m" is the the MATLAB to calculate score for each mutated gene.

File "MC_BCM.m" is the the MATLAB to find the clusters with maximum density.

To run the machine learning algorithm follow the "Read_me.txt" steps.
