# A Novel Machine Learning Method for Mutational Analysis to Identifying Driver Genes in Breast Cancer

> Description: This repository contains the data and MATLAB code for the "Identifying driver genes associated with breast cancer with machine learning algorithms".

**Data set:**

File "Benchmark.xlsx" contains a list of driver genes as benchmark sets.


**Algorithms:**

File "Feature_Matrix.m" is the MATLAB script to calculate topological and biological features for mutated genes.

File "SPNFSR.m" is the the MATLAB script to calculate score for each mutated gene.

File "MC_BCM.m" is the the MATLAB script to find the clusters with maximum density.

To run the machine learning algorithm, follow the "Read_me.txt" steps.
